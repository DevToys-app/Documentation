DevToys 2.0 comes with an SDK that empowers you to create extensions. You too can create and publish your own extensions for DevToys, expanding its functionality and making it an even more versatile tool for developers. Possibilities are infinite, giving a true meaning to a **_Swiss Army knife for Developer_**. The SDK is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.
The DevToys 2.0 SDK comes with a comprehensive set of Extension APIs. These APIs abstract some platform-specific mechanisms, such as user interface design and hard drive access, making it easier for you to focus on creating great cross-platform tools.

This documentation will guide you through the following:
- **Setting Up Your Development Environment**: We'll walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, ensuring you have all the necessary tools and configurations to start creating extensions.
- **Creating, Debugging, and Publishing an Extension**: We'll provide step-by-step instructions on how to create an extension, debug it to ensure it works as expected, and finally, publish it so that other developers can benefit from your work.
- **Best Practice Guidelines**: We'll share our guidelines for best practices to help you create high-quality extensions.

We're excited to see what you'll create with the DevToys 2.0 SDK!
